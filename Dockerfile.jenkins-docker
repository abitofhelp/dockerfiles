# MUST BE A LINUX CONTAINER!!!
#    There are the three crucial steps when running Jenkins inside docker:
#    1) You mount the socket /var/run/docker.sock to the jenkins container in order to be able to use the docker from the host.
#    2) You have to install docker inside the container in order to use it. This is a great and simple article on how to do that.
#    3) You run sudo usermod -a -G docker jenkins in order to add jenkins to the docker group. However, here you might run into 
#       a permission problem if the host docker and the container docker don't have the same group id so it is very important to 
#       adjust the container docker's gid to be the same as the host docker gid.  You can do this as a part of a launch script 
#       or simply by using exec and doing it manually: groupmod -g <YOUR_HOST_DOCKER_GID> docker.
#    *** Do not change permissions of the /var/run/docker.sock to 777 or stuff like that because that is a big security risk.
